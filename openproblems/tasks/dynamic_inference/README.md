# Dynamic inference

Dynamic inference in single-cell data is concerned with inferring or uncovering information about
the biological process that cells are undergoing. Broadly, this is also referred to as
*trajectory inference*, because we would like to have estimates of the temporal trajectory of 
observed cells.
